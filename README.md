1) Introduction
The housing market plays an important role in our day to day lives economically and socially. Given
this importance, much research goes into understanding the factors that influence house prices. In this
paper, a housing dataset from Melbourne outlining house sales between 2016 and 2017 was analysed
to provide such insights. The focus of this paper is to determine the relationship between the year
the property was constructed and the price of sale. The motivation for this stems from an expected
non-linear relationship between the year built and the price. Old builds may be viewed as ‘vintage’ or
‘antique’, driving up the price. Similarly, new builds are priced higher due to developers recuperating
costs as well as heightened demand. Meanwhile, in the range of this dataset, middle-aged houses come
in post world war eras maybe indicating poorer build quality and lower price. To achieve this, we
follow an approach utilizing MCMC and Newton’s Method.
